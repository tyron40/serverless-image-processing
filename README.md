## Overview

ImageAI is a modern, browser-based image processing application that leverages the power of TensorFlow.js to perform advanced AI analysis directly in your browser. No server uploads required - all processing happens locally, ensuring your images remain private.

## Features

### üîç Object Detection
- Identifies multiple objects within your images
- Draws accurate bounding boxes around detected objects
- Displays confidence scores for each detection
- Color-codes different object categories for easy visualization

### üè∑Ô∏è Image Classification
- Classifies the entire image content with detailed labels
- Provides confidence scores for top classifications
- Visualizes results with interactive bar charts

### üé® Color Analysis
- Extracts dominant colors from your images
- Displays color distribution percentages
- Provides visual representation of the color palette

### üìä Image Statistics
- Analyzes image dimensions and aspect ratio
- Provides technical metadata about your images

### üîí Privacy-Focused
- All processing happens in your browser
- No images are uploaded to external servers
- Your data stays on your device

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **TensorFlow.js**: Machine learning in the browser
- **COCO-SSD Model**: Pre-trained object detection
- **MobileNet Model**: Pre-trained image classification
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Vite**: Fast development environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/imageai.git
   cd imageai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image**: Drag and drop an image onto the upload area or click to browse your files.
2. **View Results**: Once uploaded, the image will be automatically processed by the AI models.
3. **Explore Different Analyses**:
   - Switch between Object Detection and Classification tabs
   - View dominant colors and image statistics
   - Examine confidence scores for detections and classifications

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed as a static site on any hosting platform:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory, which can be deployed to services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## Production Considerations

In a production environment, this application could be connected to cloud services like:

- **AWS Lambda**: For more complex image processing
- **Amazon S3**: For image storage
- **API Gateway**: For creating a scalable API
- **AWS Rekognition**: For additional AI capabilities

## Browser Compatibility

ImageAI works best in modern browsers that support WebGL and the latest JavaScript features:

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance Notes

- The initial load may take a few seconds as the TensorFlow.js models are downloaded
- Processing time depends on your device's capabilities and the image size
- For optimal performance, use images under 4MB
